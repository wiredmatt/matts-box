#       some of my clients work with social media
#       integrations, so I often find myself turning
#       these on and off. If you want to NEVER access
#       these sites, you can make the file immutable
#       in the same way we did with `dns_servers.conf`

# Loopback entries; do not change.
# For historical reasons, localhost precedes localhost.localdomain:
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
# See hosts(5) for proper format and other examples:
# 192.168.1.10 foo.example.org foo
# 192.168.1.13 bar.example.org bar
